## Introduction

This repository provides tutorials, code examples, and resources for performing financial modeling of a bootstrapped SaaS startup using Python. It is designed for entrepreneurs, financial analysts, and data scientists interested in leveraging Python to analyze and forecast the financial health of a SaaS business without external funding.

## Features

- Revenue Forecasting: Time series analysis for predicting Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR).
- Churn Analysis: Identifying and analyzing customer churn patterns.
- Cohort Analysis: Evaluating customer cohorts over time to understand retention.
- Unit Economics: Calculating key metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Lifetime Value (LTV).
- Data Preparation Scripts: Tools to clean and prepare raw SaaS data.
- KPI Calculations: Scripts to compute essential SaaS Key Performance Indicators.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python: Version 3.7 or higher
- Python Packages:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - statsmodels
  - requests
- IDE/Editor: Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or PyCharm recommended

### Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/saas-startup-financial-modeling.git
   ```

2. Change to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd saas-startup-financial-modeling
   ```

3. Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Notebooks

Interactive Jupyter notebooks covering SaaS-specific financial modeling topics are located in the `notebooks/` directory.

1. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Navigate to the Notebook:
   - Go to the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Open the desired `.ipynb` file:
     - `revenue_forecasting.ipynb`
     - `churn_analysis.ipynb`
     - `cohort_analysis.ipynb`
     - `unit_economics.ipynb`

3. Run the Notebook:
   - Execute cells sequentially or run all cells at once.

### Scripts

Standalone Python scripts for common SaaS financial tasks are located in the `scripts/` directory.

- Data Preparation:
  ```bash
  python scripts/data_preparation.py --input data/raw_saas_data.csv --output data/saas_metrics.csv
  ```

- KPI Calculations:
  ```bash
  python scripts/kpi_calculations.py --datafile data/saas_metrics.csv
  ```

### Data

Sample datasets relevant to a bootstrapped SaaS startup are located in the `data/` directory.

- `saas_metrics.csv`: Contains synthetic SaaS metrics data.
- `README.md`: Information about the data sources and usage.

Note: The data is synthetic and intended for educational purposes only.
